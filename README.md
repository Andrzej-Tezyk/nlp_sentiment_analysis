University project:  NLP- Dictionary Based Sentiment Analysis or Sentiment Analysis with ML

This project focused on sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The aim was to classify the sentiment of text data—specifically tweets—into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. The process involved data preprocessing (including cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization), feature extraction using TF-IDF, and model training using several machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The performance of these models was evaluated using metrics like accuracy and F1-score, with SVM achieving the best results.
